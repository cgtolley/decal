Here is where we will be writing a story together! Each of you will clone this file, write a sentence, and add and commit with a message, where the next person will pull. This will either happen in groups or all together, depending on how much time we have. 

As a reminder, the relevant commands in chronological order are:
git clone [ssh git link]

git add

git commit -m "message"
